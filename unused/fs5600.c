/* Two notes on path translation:
 *
 * (1) translation errors:
 *
 *   In addition to the method-specific errors listed below, almost
 *   every method can return one of the following errors if it fails to
 *   locate a file or directory corresponding to a specified path.
 *
 *   ENOENT - a component of the path doesn't exist.
 *   ENOTDIR - an intermediate component of the path (e.g. 'b' in
 *             /a/b/c) is not a directory
 *
 * (2) note on splitting the 'path' variable:
 *
 *   the value passed in by the FUSE framework is declared as 'const',
 *   which means you can't modify it. The standard mechanisms for
 *   splitting strings in C (strtok, strsep) modify the string in place,
 *   so you have to copy the string and then free the copy when you're
 *   done. One way of doing this:
 *
 *      char *_path = strdup(path);
 *      int inum = ... // translate _path to inode number
 *      free(_path);
 */


/* EXERCISE 2:
 * convert path into inode number.
 *
 * how?
 *  - first split the path into directory and file names
 *  - then, start from the root inode (which inode/block number is that?)
 *  - then, walk the dirs to find the final file or dir.
 *    when walking:
 *      -- how do I know if an inode is a dir or file? (hint: mode)
 *      -- what should I do if something goes wrong? (hint: read the above note about errors)
 *      -- how many dir entries in one inode? (hint: read Lab4 instructions about directory inode)
 *
 * hints:
 *  - you can safely assume the max depth of nested dirs is 10
 *  - a bunch of string functions may be useful (e.g., "strtok", "strsep", "strcmp")
 *  - "block_read" may be useful.
 *  - "S_ISDIR" may be useful. (what is this? read Lab4 instructions or "man inode")
 *
 * programing hints:
 *  - there are several functionalities that you will reuse; it's better to
 *  implement them in other functions.

/* EXERCISE 2:
 * Helper function:

 *        uid_t     st_uid;         // User ID of owner

 *                                  // (note: block size is FS_BLOCK_SIZE;
 *                                  // and this number is an int which should be round up)

 *        struct timespec st_mtim;  // Time of last modification
 *        struct timespec st_ctim;  // Time of last status change

 *
 *  [hints:
 *
 *    - what you should do is mostly copy.
 *
 *    - read fs_inode in fs5600.h and compare with struct stat.
 *
 *    - you can safely treat the types "ino_t", "mode_t", "nlink_t", "uid_t"
 *      "gid_t", "off_t", "blkcnt_t" as "unit32_t" in this lab.
 *
 *    - read "man clock_gettime" to see "struct timespec" definition
 *
 *    - the above "struct stat" does not show all attributes, but we don't care
 *      the rest attributes.
 *
 *    - for several fields in 'struct stat' there is no corresponding
 *    information in our file system:
 *      -- st_nlink - always set it to 1  (recall that fs5600 doesn't support links)
 *      -- st_atime - set to same value as st_mtime
